        <li><strong>Selectors:</strong> CSS3 introduces new selectors that allow for more precise targeting of HTML elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Box Model:</strong> CSS3 enhances the box model with properties like box-sizing, which allows developers to control how the size of elements is calculated.</li>
        <li><strong>Backgrounds and Borders:</strong> New properties such as border-radius, box-shadow, and multiple backgrounds provide more design options.</li>
        <li><strong>Text Effects:</strong> CSS3 includes text-shadow and other text-related properties to enhance typography.</li>
        <li><strong>Transitions and Animations:</strong> CSS3 allows for smooth transitions and animations without the need for JavaScript.</li>
